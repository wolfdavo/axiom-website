        <h3>Axiom is composed of:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Entrepreneurs</li>
          <li>Creators</li>
          <li>Leaders</li>

          <li>Innovators</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Members of Axiom have a burning desire to write their own script and carve their own path. They do not settle, and they are never satisfied. They are catalysts of change and creation.</p>
        <p>When you join Axiom, you gain access to an ever-expanding and carefully selected network of exceptional people. You have a direct line to everyone in the syndicate. We do everything we can to support each other, creating a powerful network that you can leverage to do great things.</p>
        <p>Members frequently host events where you can network and connect in person. Lunch and coffee meetings, brainstorming sessions, group workouts, and celebrations/parties are all common.</p>
        <p>All members of Axiom are seen as equal. There is no hierarchy at all. When you are accepted, you are free to invite and interview new members, host events, and network with anyone you want.</p>
        <p>There is no monetary cost associated with membership.</p>

        <h3>Member responsibilities</h3>
        <p>As a member of Axiom, you are expected to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Actively support the other members to the best of your ability. (Making connections, giving advice, etc.)</li>
          <li>Host and attend events</li>
          <li>Uphold the syndicate's values</li>
          <li>Be proactive</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Application process</h3>
        <p><b>Step One - Written Application</b></p>
        <p>The first step of joining Axiom is to fill out a written application. The application consists of questions regarding character, background, what you are working on etc. A referral by an Axiom member is a huge plus, but not required.</p>

        <p><b>Step Two - Remote interview with a member</b></p>
        <p>Once we have read your written application and established a good fit for the syndicate, we will reach out and schedule a call with you. This is either a chat over the phone or a video call. It is casual, so don't stress. You can think of it as a networking opportunity, your interviewer could be anyone in the syndicate.</p>

        <h3>Interested?</h3>
        <p>Great! We are in the process of selecting our first members. Please send a direct message on instagram to Axiom's founder, @david_wolfenden to express your interest. </p>
